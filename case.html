<b>Day 1</b><br>

<i>Not many subjects survive Separation. There is something different about this one. We shall keep a close watch on her.</i><br><br>

<b>Day 2</b><br>

<i>Test Subject 23 has been successfully placed into Stasis. We shall awaken her in two weeks.</i><br><br>

<b>Day 11</b><br>

Darkness... the sound of a struggle. Her voice calling my name. Are these dreams?<br><br>

<b>Day 16</b><br>

<i>The Awakening is nigh. Her reactions shall be recorded.</i><br>
A bright light. Someone looking down at me. He is wearing white... White... my mommy had a white bow... "Mommy...? Where are yo-aaaah!" Pain. It hurts.... please make it stop...<br>
<i>She's calling for her mother. We must stifle this reaction.</i><br>
The man in white hit me... he has a stick with electricity on it. Did he take my mommy away? "Mommy....? Mo-!" More pain... then black.<br>
<i>An unfortunate turn... she has fainted. We shall perform a second Awakening tomorrow. This subject is too important to lose.</i><br><br>

<b>Day 17</b><br>

My mommy is gone... I can't feel her anymore. The man in white must have taken her... but I can't cry... he'll hit me again. I'll be nice for him.<br>
<i>She was awake when we entered the room. Arashi has went in again to try and talk with her.</i><br>
The man is back. He doesn't have his stick this time... I look at him, his black hair slicked back and his white coat so bright. "Mister... where am I?"<br>
"You are..." <i>Arashi must not betray our secret. The test subjects cannot know they are in captivity.</i> "Something bad happened to your mother so we have taken you to a safe place. There are other kids your age here, and if you are a good little girl you might get to meet them." <i>Correct explanation. The subjects shall meet after precisely one month has passed since Separation. Currently we have only 3 new subjects, however Number 23 shows the most promise, and our leader has expressed a personal interest in her.</i> "Can you tell me your name?"<br>
My name... what was I called? I can't remember. "Um... I-I don't know, sir..." It's very strange. I can tell him the color of his coat, but I don't know my name... my head hurts...<br>
"I will call you Twenty Three, is that fine?" <i>Naming them by their numbers is unorthodox... but we shall accept it.</i><br>
Twenty Three. Is that my name? "Yes, sir."<br>
"Good. Now, can you tell me how old you are?"<br>
How old I am? I am... "Five, sir."<br>
<i>Many Test Subjects are Separated from their families at a young age, to facilitate perfect growth of their... abilities.</i><br>
"Yes, you are five years old. You are the youngest one here, actually. Well. We can't keep you here in this room, would you like to see your new room and bed?"<br>
My own room and bed? But I had a bedroom.... right? I can't remember... "Yes, sir." I stand up, and almost fall on him. I am very dizzy. He picks me up and takes my hand. "Thank you..." I then realize how cold I am, and look down. I'm only wearing my underwear! "Where are my clothes!?" <i>Predicted. Test Subjects are removed of every personal posession down to the tiniest bit of 'modesty.' This facilitates quicker adaptation to their new confinement.</i><br>
"You only have those, Twenty Three. Don't worry. Come with me." <i>Arashi will lead her to her quarters and let her get used to them, then provide her a meal. The first month will be nothing but simple interaction with her assigned Guardian (Arashi has accepted this role in addition to his Patrol one), meals, and solo 'play time' with whatever they request (within reason).</i><br>
He takes me to a very small room, but the bed is just my size. Everything is white except the floor, which is a pale green. "Sir, what is your name?" I ask.
"You can call me Arashi."<br>
Arashi... a strange name. But I guess it's not too strange. My name is Twenty Three.<br>
<i>Arashi informed her of the way things work around here and she went to sleep.</i><br><br>

<b>Day 30</b><br>

<i>One month has passed since Test Subject 23's Separation. We will prep her for the Meeting.</i><br>
"Wake up, sleepyhead."<br>
Arashi came to wake me up. He is very nice, and gave me whatever kind of toy I wanted! "Good morning, Arashi!" I say with a smile. He has a box.<br>
"I have a present for you. Open this." <i>Oddly enough this one did not seem to mind her lack of attire much after the first few days. Perhaps she will be... interesting... in a few years.</i><br>
He placed the box on my bed. Inside was a white dress! "For me?" I ask, looking up at him.<br>
"For you. Of course, you don't have to wear it. It's just something we decided you can have now. I'm sure you're used to just wearing those though."<br>
He poked my waistband. "Hehe. It was strange at first... but I guess that is the way I was supposed to be." I nod and put the dress back in it's box.<br>
"Alright then. Take your breakfast and then we will go meet the other people here." <i>First Meeting with the other Subjects is always one month after Separation. Test Subject 10 and Test Subject 14 are the only two surviving Subjects, so this Meeting won't take too long. Which is good, because it gives us time to analyze all interaction at our own leisure.</i><br>
I nodded and ate the food he gave me, and then looked up at him. "OK, I am ready."<br>
"Good, follow me."<br>
He went back out the door, and waved for me to follow. This is the first time I've been outside this room since he led me here. We took a few paths but I can't remember where all the turns were. "Where are we going, Arashi?"<br>
"To the Meeting Hall. You are about to meet Ten and Fourteen."<br>
Ten and Fourteen. More people like me? "Are they nice?"<br>
"As nice as can be. They have been here longer, though." <i>Number 10 has been here for 12 years. His Separation was at age 5 just like Number 23. Number 14, however, is only 4 weeks past his first Meeting, and was Separated at age 8, making Number 23 the youngest.</i><br>
We went into a big circle shaped room. Two men in white coats stood in the middle, along with an older boy and a teenager. Teenager... words I don't know why I know them but I do... "Arashi, who is who?"<br>
The teenager spoke up. "Hello cutie... you're Twenty Three, right? I'm Ten, nice to meet you." He smiled at me. I guess that means the boy must be Fourteen. "H-Hi..." I said, not leaving Arashi's side. Ten was wearing a white shirt and pants. Fourteen was in his underwear just like me.<br>
<i>Only Number 10 expressed an interest in wearing clothing other than undergarments. Number 14 only wears a shirt, and only for sleeping. Number 23 is an exception, wearing just her undergarments at all times.</i><br>
"Introduce yourself, Fourteen." The man standing behind the boy had black hair just like Arashi.... I don't know what color hair I have. I can't remember.<br>
"Hello... I'm F-Fourteen..." the boy said to me. I looked at him, and he smiled a bit at me. Maybe these people can be friends? I never had friends before.<br>
<i>The rest of the Meeting went smoothly. They all got to know each other and Number 10 has decided to treat Number 23 as his 'sister' for some reason.</i><br><br>

<b>Day 150</b><br>

<i>MEM: Nothing of note for the past 7 months. No exhibition of ability from Number 23, but that has been said to be expected. Number 10 has been training nonstop, and Number 14 has learned he has a measure of control over his own ability.</i><br>
Ten is awesome! He can make light come from his hands and lots of neat things! He put his glowy hand on my belly once, it tickled alot!<br>
<i>There is no taboo in this Test. Subjects can interact in any way imaginable. However, certain interactions may place undue stress on our younger subjects, so those shall be monitored closely.</i><br>
Fourteen seems shy around me, but I saw him the other day playing with a floating ice cube! He must have some kind of power like Ten. I wish I had a power.<br><br>

<b>Day 178</b><br>

<i>MEM: Number 23 has discovered her ability.</i><br>
I have power! Yay! I found out by accident the other day when Ten was tickling my belly after lunch. I touched his hand and his whole arm started to glow! I must be able to make other people stronger! Arashi told me that I'm very special.<br>
<i>We have received information that they have found another potential Test Subject. I only wish that this one survives Separation. Number 23 has been confirmed to be a Catalyst. Our leader's interest in her has grown.</i><br>
Arashi showed me he has a power too! He can make ice, light, and fire! I touched his hand the other day and he shot an ice ball all the way across the Hall!<br><br>

<b>Day 200</b><br>

<i>Number 23 and Number 14's Guardians have informed them that, like Number 10, they now have free run of the Enclosure. Number 14 opted to stay in his own room most of the time, but Number 23 wanders the halls, exploring the area. Is this cause for concern? We shall have to observe further.</i><br><br>

<b>Day 210</b><br>

<i>Test Subject 24 passed away. The Separation was too much, emotionally. His ability was also unrefined, and his body shut down as a result.</i><br><br>

<b>Day 240</b><br>

Ten said he had a secret for me. I went to meet him in his room. <i>We are observing this meeting carefully. It seems Number 10 wishes to interact privately with Number 23.</i><br><br><br>

***RECORD HIDDEN***<br>

<i>Number 10 fulfilled his wish. Number 23 is in pain, but surviving. She fell asleep on Number 10's bed, and he left the room. We moved her back to her own room afterward. Her ability did not diminish as a result of the stress. She will be cleansed during the night.</i><br><br>

<b>Day 365</b><br>

<i>One year has passed since acquisition of Number 23. Number 10 has formed a close bond with her, and Number 14 has been experimenting. We have informed them all that the interactions they have are not to be done haphazardly. Tomorrow Number 23 shall begin her first Trials.</i><br>
Ten is really nice to me. He gives me secrets every few days. Fourteen gave me a secret the other day too! I think Ten taught him how, but he's really clumsy. Arashi told me though that we're gonna be separated from each other after today, so I gave Ten a big hug and said goodbye after lunch.<br>
<i>It will be painful for them, but this second Separation is needed. They have learned to interact, now they must learn to survive. Number 10 has done so many times, so he has been allowed to stay in the Enclosure. He believes this to be his home now anyway.</i><br><br>

<b>Day 730</b><br>

<i>Everything has gone horribly wrong! Number 14 was found in his room, dead. Arashi is nowhere to be found, his Tracer has been deactivated. Number 23 is our only hope, as Number 10 was taken for further testing a week ago. I have sent Toshiro to her to explain what she has to do.</i><br>
"Twenty Three, are you awake?"<br>
A strange voice. Who is this? "Yes? Come in." Oh. It's Ten's friend. The man that was with him when we first met. "Where is Arashi?"<br>
"That is the reason I am here. Something bad has happened. You may not want to hear this, but Fourteen has been killed, and we think Arashi did it."<br>
Fourteen, dead? He was my friend! And Arashi! But why? "Why, sir?"<br>
"Arashi is missing, we cannot find him. And he never did like Fourteen."<br>
"But what do you expect me to do?"<br>
"Find him."<br>
Find him... how? Wait! I can still feel him... he's nearby... but I don't know where. "I understand..."<br>
"Here, take this, you will need it."<br>
The man gave me a box just like the one all those days ago. This one had a shirt and pants like Ten wears, but in my size. "I don't wan-"<br>
"You must, we are allowing you Outside, and you cannot wear just your undergarments Outside."<br>
I look at him and frown. "Outside?"<br>
"Yes, you will understand soon. Please dress."<br>
I nod and put on the clothes, watching Ten change so often, I knew how to put mine on.<br>
"Follow me."<br>
The man led me to a door I have never seen open before, a big grey one with yellow stripes on it. He pressed a button on it and it slowly slid open, revealing...<br>
"Outside. It's very different from inside the Camp."<br>
It was different. There were so many colors! The blue of sky, the brown of dirt, the green of leaves! I had learned about all this stuff Inside but never saw more than a picture on a book. The man gave me one more box and then turned around and walked away a bit.<br>
"Open this when you find Arashi." <i>She left the Camp, armed with nothing but her clothes and an Autotracker. Her chance of survival was minimum.</i><br><br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Day 1900</b><br>

<i>The original Observation Team has been eliminated. Arashi has gone rogue. Number 23 hasn't been seen since that day so long ago. Lady Amaya has no input on the situation, and I fear it was her doing all along. Number 10 was dispatched to find Number 23 a week after she left, but he hasn't returned either, and I fear they have both been captured and destroyed by the government. Our operation was a failure. I write this entry in secret, having found the journal in my search of what was left of the Camp. It is a total wreck, all the work of Arashi. His powers are too much for even our Elite Patrollers. If anyone finds this, please let it stand as a testimony to our disaster and as a reminder to never repeat our mistake. Those with 'abilities' are not lab rats to study, they are human just like the rest of us... signed: Takashi.</i><br><br><br>
