<b>Her Story</b><br>
Terra is a unique individual, a small pixie girl with a big heart.<br>
She is 'supposed' to have control over electricity, but unfortunately for her she hasn't figured out just quite how to yet. But that's not for lack of trying! She does know how to travel through wires and the power grid though. And can make little sparks with her fingertip and tail.<br>
She often finds herself in trouble though, and usually needs the help of someone much bigger than her to get out of it. Maybe somebody can take her on as a travel companion?<hr width="50%" color>
<b>General Description</b><br>
She's super curious about things, loves to eat (though she's not fat, she just likes to 'share' from normal-sized people's plates), pale tan skin with blue hair, blue eyes and wings, tail tipped with a blue star shape.<hr width="50%" color>
<b>Out of Character</b><br>
Open to any kind of RP, within reason. Eastern time zone.<br>
