<hr>
<u>Bio</u>: Ever a curious scientist, Trip spends most of his time studing various Reploid technology. Of late, he has been interested in these "biometals" that have been surfacing. After securing access to an old ruined lab, he came across an unclaimed Biometal, Model Zeta. No sooner had he reached out to touch it, than it had activated and clamed him as it's "Chosen One." Trip knew from his studies what a Chosen One was, but was nonetheless not really prepared for it - for to be "Chosen" was to be thrust into the "Game of Destiny," which essentially he was now at war with the other Chosen Ones. However, he has as of current managed to keep himself quite hidden.<br><br>
<u>Equipment</u>: * Biometal Model Zeta: This unit of "Live Metal" contains the spirit and knowledge of a feared Maverick from the past, Shakahn'ti - otherwise known as the Beast. Trip can Biomerge with it, gaining an armored exosuit, increased agility and strength, and the twin Chaos Blades.<br>
* Standard-Issue Hunter Buster: This is basically a small beam pistol, mainly used for self-defense. Trip is quite proficient with it, and can hit a 6-inch target from 50 yards.<br>
* Custom-Built Tablet PC: His pride and joy, a tablet computer loaded with a self-made OS. It has his research notes, his journal, and a sampling of games for when there is any downtime.<br><br>
<u>Megamerged Equipment</u>: * Chaos Blades: One 'Light' and one 'Dark', these are just modified beam swords, honed to a fine edge and set at a high frequency so as to be able to cut through most metals.<br>
* Model Zeta Armor: This vaguley insectoid armor suit provides much better protection from attacks than his street clothes do, and it also enhances his speed and strength to superhuman - no, MEGA MAN levels.</font></center></div>

Note that this is always a work in progress.<br><br>
Please note that my preferred post length is 2-3 sentences. It's hard for me to keep up with the flow of RP when my partner is using semi-para+.<br><br>
I'm a pretty easygoing person, really. I'm open to clean or dirty RP, and I am currently working on starting my own RP as well.<br><br>
If you need to speak with me offsite, I use Skype. (Will provide Skype Name upon request.)<br>
I work most days, and my schedule is very strange, so if I seem unavailable at times, that's probably where I am.<br><br>
Oh yes, if you need coding help, I am available to help. I am still learning the ropes myself, but I hope to one day master both HTML and CSS.<br><br>
-STATUS KEY-<br>
~A~ - I'm the owner of the room I'm in.<br>
Profiling - I'm working on either my profile or helping someone else.<br>
PM Friendly - I am available for PM RP.<br>
Busy - I am in a PM RP session, and will be slow responding in the room.<br>
Very Busy - I am "Really Into" a PM RP session, and will NOT respond in the room.<br>
Away - Self-explanatory.<br>
Other than that, any status will just reflect a form or mood.</center></div></div>
