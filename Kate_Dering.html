<hr>
<u>Bio</u>: Born to Dr. Trip Dering and his wife Kim, Kate is a product of both nature and science. Trip was a researcher in the field of nanotechnology, but abandoned his colleagues to pursue slightly less orthodox applications. His intentions were to produce nanomachines that could assist in medical applications, but had no test subjects. Eventually he got his wife to agree, and they set about injecting her unborn child with the nanites. The operation was a success, and the Dering family went into hiding so as to not attract unwanted attention.<br>
Kate grew up as normally as could be expected, living in seclusion as she was. Everything was fine up until she was 5. She sustained a great injury in a lab accident (having grown up helping her father in research) and needed to be fitted with her robotic arm, thus sealing Trip's inevitable fate. Things went smoothly up until a few months before her 12th birthday. Trip, having sensed that he had been found by Mavericks, had designed Kate's armor suit and had given it to her, telling her that she must always strive for peace. As if by some cruel twist of fate, that very evening her family was attacked! Her parents were killed by Mavericks, and had it not been for one certain Reploid, she would have been taken captive. Will she ever meet him again?<br><br>
<u>Equipment</u>: * DDN-000 Nanite System: The Dr. Dering Nanite System was designed after months of research and experimentation in the field of biological machinery. In essence, they are a nearly infinite amount of specialized self-replicating molecules based on Reploid "DNA" in the fact that they have a simple kind of intelligence. They react both to nerve impulses and thoughts, the latter via a control node implanted in Kate's brain.<br>
* Her robotic arm: This arm, created specifically for her after an accident at age 5, and upgraded and enlarged as her body grew, can both interface with her Nanite System and with standard computer terminals, allowing for her to "download" information directly to her mind.<br>
* DDN-001 Prototype Personal Armor: This compact, form-fitting outfit contains thin plates of Titanium-X alloy infused with microscopic mechanics and small shield generators allowing for enhanced range of motion and strength coupled with boosted defense. In essence it would provide resistance to blunt and bladed weaponry, and lessen the impact from beam weaponry, and allow her to "dash boost" via thrusters in the feet. It can be stored in a "backpack" like device, and activated by nanite interface in order to shift to a complete armor in only 5 seconds.<br>
* The Plasma Rod: At first glance, your standard "beam sword" weapon. But the Plasma Rod is different in one major way, in that it can be reconfigured to many shapes other than just a sword (notable ones are Glaive, Shield, and Whip). Given to her by a mysterious black-armored Reploid that seems to have ties with the family.<br><br>
<u>Skills and Techniques</u>: * Self-Healing: Kate can, under certain stress-free circumstances, place her own body into a sort of stasis where she seems to be sleeping. In this condition, her nanite system can begin to repair minor injuries to her body (i.e. cuts, bruises, burns, small punctures). This cannot heal major injuries.<br>
* The Nano Pulse: Used only as a last resort move, Kate can actually force nanites from the palm of her human hand into whatever she's touching (if it is not protected with a force shield or such). Once in the target's body, they coalesce into a single unit and superheat to the point of meltdown, causing pain and damage to the target. The whole process from initial touch to final meltdown takes around 15 seconds. This leaves her mentally and physically drained, and as such she may have to retreat to a safe place.</font></center></div>

<u>Bio</u>: Kate (real name Susan Rivers) is the latest in a long line of female children descended from the original Kate Dering (the X-Series one). Due to something in the programming of the nanites, Kate's firstborn child was a female. It was discovered about halfway through her pregnancy that the nanite system had broken down it's control core in Kate's brain and rebuilt a new one in the brain of the fetus. Shortly before birth, the full set of nanites had moved from Kate's body into the child, leaving Kate powerless save for her arm and weapons. This persisted through 8 generations, stretching over 200 years. Susan, the latest in the lineage, learned of her heritage and ancestry from old records in the City's database, and from stories passed down via her mother and grandmother. Now at her 17th birthday, she has set out into the world to find out just how much she can learn from other sources, taking on the name of her ancestor to continue the legacy. And the lure of power is strong... she has heard of these so-called "biometals" and wants one for herself.<br><br>
<u>Equipment</u>: * DDN-000 Nanite System: The Nanites have made their home in this girl now, and as such serve as her link to the digital and Reploid world. Due to their self-replicating nature, they are as functional now as they were over 200 years ago.<br>
* The Plasma Rod: Passed down her family line, Kate is self-taught with this amazing weapon. However, due to it's age, it no longer has the capabilities it once had, and now can only be used in sword mode.<br>
* Hacked Credit Chip: This marvelous device ensures that she never runs out of funds to purchase necessary items. It is linked to a rotating sample of bank accounts, and as such is always loaded with cash.<br><br>
<u>Skills and Techniques</u>: * Nanite Skills: Kate can utilize the same set of skills that her ancestor could, including self-healing and the nanopulse.<br>
* Athleticism: Kate is pretty athletic, and can scale walls with ease. She can also jump almost her own height, due in part to her nanites enhancing her muscles.

Emphasized greatly for, well... emphasis. I hate being forced to write more than I deem necessary.<br><br>
I'm a pretty easygoing person, really. I'm open to clean or dirty RP, and I am currently working on starting my own RP as well.<br><br>
If you need to speak with me offsite, I use Skype. (Will provide Skype Name upon request.)<br>
I work most days, and my schedule is very strange, so if I seem unavailable at times, that's probably where I am.<br><br>
Oh yes, if you need coding help, I am available to help. I am still learning the ropes myself, but I hope to one day master both HTML and CSS.<br><br>
-STATUS KEY-<br>
~A~ - I'm the owner of the room I'm in.<br>
Profiling - I'm working on either my profile or helping someone else.<br>
PM Friendly - I am available for PM RP.<br>
Busy - I am in a PM RP session, and will be slow responding in the room.<br>
