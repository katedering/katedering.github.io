 <u>Status:</u> Lost and alone.<br><br>
 <u>Bio:</u> It happened one night, as the town was sleeping. All was well with the world, until HE showed up. The mysterious person called down ancient magic upon the town, and summoned powerful beings that razed the houses and burned the crops. Phoebe was driven from her house by her parents, who died in the attack, and was about to be ripped asunder by a fearsome beast. At the last possible moment, a dragon appeared from nowhere and drove the beast away, then carried the girl off to a safe place. She was no older than three. The dragon cared for her in place of her parents, and taught her the basics of language. Upon her fifth birthday, it wiped all traces of it's existence from her mind and vanished, leaving her to wander about by herself. She has no family, no friends, and no past.<br><br>
 <u>Powers:</u> None controllable as of yet. If she gets severely emotional, she can sometimes call forth energy from her hands, in the form of glowing pulses. These fire randomly and are very dangerous.</font><br><br>

 <b>Lost Little Girl:</b> (Default) You're an explorer/adventurer/etc. traveling through a dense forest, and wander upon this poor little girl. She has no idea how she got here, and you are filled with compassion for her, to the point that you take her along with you on your journey.<br>
 (Smut Version) The above scenario pans out, but you're plagued with the urge to relieve sexual tension, and what better partner than your new friend?<br><br>
 <b>The Experiment:</b> A slightly darker story, the girl was the last in a line of experiments by a corrupt government/etc. that stripped young children from their families, doing all sorts of tests to them. The experiments were shut down, but she was left behind in a holding room somehow. You find her while combing the facility for technology.<br><br>
 Feel free to come up with something else!</font>

 Note that this is always a work in progress.<br>
 Always in character, unless you first approach me with some kind of indication of OOC.<br>
 This character is designed for CLEAN ROLEPLAY in the main. If you come asking for smut without a plot, prepare to be ignored.<br>
 I rarely, if ever, roleplay in PM with non-human characters. You've got to get on my good side for that.<br><br>
 <u><i><b>I WILL NOT ROLEPLAY WITH ANYONE THAT FORCES MORE THAN TWO SENTENCES!</b></i></u><br>
 Emphasized greatly for, well... emphasis. I can't stand being forced to write more than I deem necessary.<br>
 And before you start complaining, you don't need a freaking novel just to "visualize the scene." Leave it to imagination. If your imagination is so limited that I have to write my life history on every post, then go away.<br><br>
 I will not share information for offsite contact.<br><br>
 -STATUS KEY-<br>
 ~A~ - I'm the room owner in the room I am in.<br>
 Profiling - I'm working on either my profile or helping someone else.<br>
 PM Friendly - I am available for PM RP.<br>
 Busy - I am in a PM RP session, and will be slow responding in the room.<br>
 Very Busy - I am "Really Into" a PM RP session, and will NOT respond in the room.<br>
 Away - Self-explanatory.<br>
 Other than that, any status will just reflect a form or mood.<br>
